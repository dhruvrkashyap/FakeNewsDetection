# Fake News Detection
Fake news is often reverberated as misinformation in social media but occasionally finds it's way to the mainstream media as well. It is important that we have some mechanism for detecting fake news, or at the very least, an awareness that not everything we read on social media and otherwebsites is true. This project will make people more informed. It will make a small contribution against one of the most prevalent hazard of modern times, i.e. Fake News. The application flow will be as
follows:

1. User will input the news headline to verify.
2. The machine learning models deployed will work on the data.
3. The model will return the result after checking whether the news is fake or real.
